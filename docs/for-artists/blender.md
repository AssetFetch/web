## Installation

### Via Drag-and-Drop

Install the latest version of the AssetFetch addon by simply dragging the link below into Blender from your web browser.

Blender will recognize it as an extension and start the installation.

[Drag this link into Blender to install AF 0.4 for Blender 4.5](https://github.com/AssetFetch/blender/releases/download/0.4.0/assetfetch-0.4.0.zip?repository=https://assetfetch.org/extensions/blender/index.json){.md-button}

!!! note
	If this is the first time you install AssetFetch, Blender will prompt you to trust the `assetfetch.org` repository.
