# AssetFetch: Integrated 3D Asset Discovery and Imports for Everybody

AssetFetch is an open system for browsing, retrieving and handling/importing digital assets for media creation with a focus on easy implementation.
The AssetFetch Protocol provides a simple way for artists to interact with publicly available 3D asset libraries without the need to leave their current software.

Such functionality was previously only achievable through vendor- and software-specific plugins like the [Poliigon 3DSMax Addon](https://www.poliigon.com/3ds-max), [Poly Haven Asset Browser](https://blendermarket.com/products/poly-haven-asset-browser) or [Quixel Bridge](https://quixel.com/plugins/).

AssetFetch aims to generalize the interaction with vendors by offering a simple HTTP- and JSON-based API specification which clients can use to receive files and metadata from asset vendors.
This way, **artists** can use a single AssetFetch-Plugin per application to browse the collection of all participating vendors.
**Vendors** can profit from only needing to implement one simple API instead of having to develop and maintain a set of highly-specialized plugins.

!!! note "Project Status"
	AssetFetch is currently in the early stages of development, meaning that the specification itself is still subject to changes and improvements.
